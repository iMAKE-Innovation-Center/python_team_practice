# these examples will demonstrate how to do simple addition in Python
#   will involve the print function, addition operators and variables

# how to print simple addition
#   make sure that the numbers you put in the print statement are not strings
#   they must be an integer or float to properly add together
#   include the + operator between the two numbers

# correct way of addition in print
print('1 + 1 =', 1 + 1)

# incorrect way of addition in print
#   print
print("1 + 1 is incorrect if with quotes")
print('1 + 1 is incorrect if with quotes')


# how to print simple addition using variables
#   variables are a 'container' that stores an assigned value
#   variables can be changed at any time

# assigning value to x
#   print
x = 3
print('x =', x)

# assigning value to y
#   print
y = 5
print('y =', y)

# printing x and y
print('x + y =', x + y)


# variable can be assigned variables too!
#   as long as the variable is getting a variable with a value
#   print
sum = x + y
print('sum =', sum)


# you can add up by 1 using this operator shortcut
#   x += i is equivalent of typing x = x + i
#   it is used because it is a shorter way of typing it

# z = 1
#   print
z = 1
print('z =', z)

# z = z + 1
#   print
z += 1
print('z =', z)


# you can add negative numbers using the addition operator
#   just remember to include the - sign

# a = -3
#   print
a = -3
print('a =', a)

# b = 4
#   print
b = 4
print('b =', b)

# print a + b
print('a + b =', a + b)
