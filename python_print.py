# these  examples will demonstrate how to print in Python
#   it will also demonstrate how single and double quotes interact
#   note: output will be in the comments before the code


# in Python, any letters, numbers, symbols, etc. between a single or double quote is called a string
# a string is simply defined as a sequence of characters
#   for example: "hello" and 'hello' are considered strings


# Hello World!
#   print without quations
#   two different ways and both are correct
print("Hello World!")
print('Hello World!')


# 'Hello World'
#   print with single quations
#   make sure to use the double quotes first to sandwhich the single quotes
print("'Hello World'")


# "Hello World!"
#   print with double quotes
#   make sure to use the single quotes first to sandwhich the double quotes
print('"Hello World!"')
